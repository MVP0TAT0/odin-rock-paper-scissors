A Rock Paper Scissors game built as part of The Odin Project - Foundations curriculum.
The goal of this project is to create a simple interactive game using JavaScript, focusing on core programming fundamentals and basic DOM manipulation.

This project demonstrates core front-end skills including:
- JavaScript fundamentals (variables, functions, conditionals, loops)
- Writing game logic
- Handling user input
- Basic DOM manipulation and event handling
- Connecting JavaScript with HTML and CSS

The original assignment outlines the required functionalities, starting with a console-based version and later enhancing it with a user interface.
